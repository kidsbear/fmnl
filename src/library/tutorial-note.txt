` Note is one of three types of ELEMENTs in this language

` Numbers are music notes. 1-7 represent do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti respectively.
` You need "1" as a function argument to use 1-7 notation, since 2-7 are actually
`  predefined to be 2=##1, 3=##2, 4=#3, 5=##4, 6=##5, 7=##6
export function <notes>(1) = 135

` Make a note sharp with '#'
export function <with-sharp5>(1) = 13#5

` Make a note flat with 'b'
export function <with-flat5>(1) = 13b5

` Make a note one higher octave with '/'
export function <with-higher-octave-5>(1) = 13/5

` Make a note one lower octave with '\'
export function <with-lower-octave-5>(1) = 13\5

` Except for numbers, capped letters can also be used as note names
` Following is equivalent to <notes>
export function <notes-alternative>(X) = X####X#######X
