` Wrapper is the last type of ELEMENT.
` They are simply ELEMENTs wrapped by [].
function <wrapped>(1) = [123]

` Recall functions are applied to notes and may completely change some structures.
` For example:
function <double>(1) = 11
export function <no-wrap>(1) = <double>(123) ` = 112233

` What if you don't want its structure to be changed? Use a wrapper!
` Wrappers similar to notes when functions are applied.
` It protects its inner structures.
export function <wrap>(1) = <double>[123] ` = [123][123]

` Similarly it's great to protect lists that serve as chords.
export function <wrap2>(1) = ((1,3)[(3,5)])* ` = 1[(3,5)]3[(3,5)]
